Higher oil prices mean higher costs for Indian net importers. \\nThe domestic market was also weighed down by foreign investors' move to offload significant amounts of shares, with analysts suggesting investments going to China instead following its recent stimulus measures. \\nAt close, the BSE Sensex slumped 806.65 points, or 1.0%, to 81,688.45, while the NSE Nifty 50 dropped 200.25 points, or 0.7%, to 25,049.85. \\nMahindra & Mahindra (NSE:M&M, \\nM_M\\n) emerged as the top loser on Friday, with shares sliding 4%, followed by Bajaj Finance (SE:BAJFINANCE, \\nBAJFINANCE\\n) and Nestle India \\nNESTLEIND\\n. \\nConversely, Infosys \\nINFY\\n, Oil & Natural Gas Corp. \\nONGC\\n and HDFC Life Insurance \\nHDFCLIFE\\n were the top performers. \\nIn corporate news, HDFC Bank \\nHDFCBANK\\n said its gross advances climbed 1.3% to Rs 2.5 million Indian rupees in the quarter ended September following a 0.8% drop in the previous quarter.\\n\", 'Brent crude prices touched the $78 per barrel mark in early trade on October 4, clocking its biggest one-day rise in almost a year after President Joe Biden told reporters the US was discussing whether to support potential Israeli strikes against Iranian oil facilities.\\nTurmoil\\xa0in the Markets\\nThe surge in crude prices is showing up in the share prices of oil exploration PSU ONGC, which is higher by over 2% in Friday\\'s session, while oil marketing companies IOC, HPCL and BPCL are lower by 1-2.5%.\\nInvestors are worried about an Israeli strike on Iranian oil refining assets, which may evoke a retaliation and thus escalate the ongoing conflict.\\nRead More: How oil surge can spoil the stock market sentiment\\nCentre Watching Closely\\nCNBC-TV18 quoted government officials on October 4, who said that India is bound to be impacted by the spillover of the ongoing global development and it is watching crude prices closely but is not unduly worried. Centre has tools to deal with volatile crude oil prices, the official said, adding that India has seen much higher crude oil prices in the past, and current prices are not at those levels yet.\\nRead More: What the oil spike means for India\\'s macros\\nBiden \\'Discussing\\' Israel\\'s Response\\nUnited States, the European Union, and other allies have called for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict, and President Biden said the US was discussing with Israel its response, including strike on Iran\\'s oil facilities. \"We\\'re discussing that,\" Biden told reporters.\\n\"First of all, we don\\'t \\'allow\\' Israel, we advise Israel. And there is nothing going to happen today,\" Biden told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\\xa0When asked if he was urging Israel not to attack Iran\\'s oil installations, Biden said he would not negotiate in public.\\nRisk of Supply Disruption?\\n“The market fear is that there could be supply disruptions coming out of Iran,” Bloomberg News quoted Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. \"Demand for oil should remain healthy, but at the same time the risk to the supply side is very much there.\"\\nBoth Nymex and Brent crude prices were headed for weekly gains of about 8%.\\n\"The question now is whether there will be an actual disruption in crude supplies, and that should keep prices in a waiting game over the weekend,\" IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong told Reuters.\\nANZ analysts said in a note,\\xa0\"Supply risks are back in focus as tension in the Middle East rises, but we expect the impact to be limited.\"\\nThe note added that any strike by Israel on Iran\\'s oil assets \"would upset its international partners while a disruption to\\xa0Iran\\'s oil revenue would likely leave it with little to lose, potentially provoking a more ferocious response.\"\\nIt should be noted that oil producers\\' cartel OPEC has spare production capacity, and global crude supplies are not yet disrupted by the Middle East unrest.\\nIsrael\\'s Action Continues\\n', 'The domestic equity indices, Sensex and Nifty 50, opened flat on October 4 but quickly slid into negative territory as escalating tensions in the Middle East kept investors on edge ahead of the crucial September US payrolls report.

However, due to current geopolitical tensions, there\\'s a new level of scepticism in the market,\" said Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities.\\nNifty Bank extended its losing streak for the fifth consecutive session, slipping 0.3 percent as key stocks like ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra lagged. Nifty Auto also faced pressure, declining 0.7 percent, with valuation concerns weighing heavily on the sector. Oil and gas stocks remained under pressure for the fourth session in a row, driven by fears of potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil installations amidst rising Middle East tensions.\\n', 'The domestic equity market took a sharp hit at the open on October 3, with both the Sensex and Nifty 50 plunging over 1 percent each, pressured by mixed global cues and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East\\nAt 9.16 AM, the Sensex was down 877 points or 1 percent at 83,389 and the Nifty was down 259 points at 25,537. About 620 shares advanced, 2,024 shares declined, and 149 shares remained unchanged.\\nMarket sentiment was shaken as the Middle East conflict intensified, with Israel launching a ground operation into Lebanon and conducting airstrikes, while Iran retaliated with a ballistic missile strike following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.\\nThe India VIX, often referred to as the market\\'s fear gauge, spiked more than 8 percent, reaching 13.\\nFollow our live blog for all the market action\\n\"If there is a larger retaliation or further escalation in the Middle East, it could lead to heightened geopolitical tensions, which might impact equity markets globally, including India.
