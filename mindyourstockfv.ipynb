The country already has an historical advantage in data mining and interpretation.\"\\nSince February, India has opened its space sector to private players and created a 10 billion rupee ($119 million) venture fund to support space startups. It has also unveiled plans for crewed space exploration and a mission to Venus, but the focus is on developing commercial ventures.\\nIn many ways it will be an uphill fight. Other countries such as Japan and China have advanced space industries, and designs on cheap launches. Spaceflight itself is difficult; the startup landscape globally is littered with failed boosters and satellite designs.\\nFor India, \"the tech is there and the ability is there... but space is tricky and very competitive, and while private companies have shown that they can create a niche for themselves, we need more proof of concept,\" said Namrata Goswami, a space policy expert at Arizona State University.\\nShe added that the Indian government must be an \"anchor customer\" for private industry.\\nMost of the revenue growth is expected to come from so-called downstream data applications, said Pawan Goenka, chairman of IN-SPACe, India\\'s space regulatory body.\\nThose involve crunching data from orbit to help improve crop yields on earth, build more accurate navigation systems, bolster telecommunications, tighten border security and fight climate change, Goenka said.\\nIndian companies such as Bellatrix Aerospace, Pixxel, Agnikul Cosmos, Dhruva Space and others are already building or have launched small satellites or satellite components.\\nIndia\\'s space agency, ISRO, last month completed the third and final developmental flight for its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle. The design will then be handed to private companies.\\n\"The end uses of Earth observation are vast,\" Goenka said. \"What we are doing is address various parts of the puzzle.\"\\nBengaluru-based SatSure, for example, has been providing near real-time satellite data to the Airports Authority of India to enhance air traffic management and safety, helping airlines save fuel costs by improved flight planning. The project is expected to save 37.5 billion rupees ($446 million) in fuel costs for airlines annually by 2025 and result in a roughly 70% reduction in airport process planning timelines, the authority said.\\nEarth observation (EO) satellites - orbiting cameras and sensors - can unlock similar savings in other areas, said the company\\'s chief executive, Prateep Basu.\\n\"EO is solving problems that span across utilities, navigation, trading, industries, helping save millions of dollars,\" Basu said.\\nGOVERNMENT PUSH\\nSince the government opened up the market, companies big and small have jumped in, with legacy IT firms like Infosys \\nINFY1!\\n investing in satellite imaging company GalaxEye Space Solutions, Google-backed \\nGOOG\\n Pixxel signing contracts with NASA, and Baring- and Promus-backed SatSure taking on clients such as HDFC Bank \\nHDFCBANK\\n and global seed company Syngenta.\\nDhruva Space became one of the first to be handed a permit to operate satellite communication centres on earth - to date the dominion of ISRO.\\n\"India is a software powerhouse and produces some of the best minds in the world in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The space downstream market is, at the end of the day, a software play,\" said Aravind Ravichandran, founder of France-based advisory firm Terrawatch Space.\\nThe consultancy Euroconsult forecasts that between 2023 and 2032, about 26,104 small satellites - weighing less than 500 kilogrammes (1,100 lb) - will be put in orbit, averaging 1.5 tons of daily launch mass. The firm expects the overall small satellite industry to be worth $110.5 billion in the next decade.\\nIndian space companies have already seen an influx of funding - $126 million in 2023, a 7% increase from the $118 million raised in 2022 and an increase of 235% from the $37.6 million raised in 2021, according to Tracxn data. \\nBut India has only about 2% of market share in commercial space activities, demand is still largely dependent on global clients, and well-established U.S., Russian and Chinese companies are formidable rivals.\\n     \"To truly make a dent, (Indian) solutions have to scale to the rest of south Asia and then to the rest of the world,\" said Pixxel founder and CEO Awais Ahmed.\\n($1 = 84.0560 Indian rupees)\\n', 'Sensex and Nifty extended their losses by 0.3 percent each by noon on October 11, pulled down by banking and auto stocks.

The country already has an historical advantage in data mining and interpretation.\"\\nSince February, India has opened its space sector to private players and created a 10 billion rupee ($119 million) venture fund to support space startups. It has also unveiled plans for crewed space exploration and a mission to Venus, but the focus is on developing commercial ventures.\\nIn many ways it will be an uphill fight. Other countries such as Japan and China have advanced space industries, and designs on cheap launches. Spaceflight itself is difficult; the startup landscape globally is littered with failed boosters and satellite designs.\\nFor India, \"the tech is there and the ability is there... but space is tricky and very competitive, and while private companies have shown that they can create a niche for themselves, we need more proof of concept,\" said Namrata Goswami, a space policy expert at Arizona State University.\\nShe added that the Indian government must be an \"anchor customer\" for private industry.\\nMost of the revenue growth is expected to come from so-called downstream data applications, said Pawan Goenka, chairman of IN-SPACe, India\\'s space regulatory body.\\nThose involve crunching data from orbit to help improve crop yields on earth, build more accurate navigation systems, bolster telecommunications, tighten border security and fight climate change, Goenka said.\\nIndian companies such as Bellatrix Aerospace, Pixxel, Agnikul Cosmos, Dhruva Space and others are already building or have launched small satellites or satellite components.\\nIndia\\'s space agency, ISRO, last month completed the third and final developmental flight for its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle. The design will then be handed to private companies.\\n\"The end uses of Earth observation are vast,\" Goenka said. \"What we are doing is address various parts of the puzzle.\"\\nBengaluru-based SatSure, for example, has been providing near real-time satellite data to the Airports Authority of India to enhance air traffic management and safety, helping airlines save fuel costs by improved flight planning. The project is expected to save 37.5 billion rupees ($446 million) in fuel costs for airlines annually by 2025 and result in a roughly 70% reduction in airport process planning timelines, the authority said.\\nEarth observation (EO) satellites - orbiting cameras and sensors - can unlock similar savings in other areas, said the company\\'s chief executive, Prateep Basu.\\n\"EO is solving problems that span across utilities, navigation, trading, industries, helping save millions of dollars,\" Basu said.\\nGOVERNMENT PUSH\\nSince the government opened up the market, companies big and small have jumped in, with legacy IT firms like Infosys \\nINFY1!\\n investing in satellite imaging company GalaxEye Space Solutions, Google-backed \\nGOOG\\n Pixxel signing contracts with NASA, and Baring- and Promus-backed SatSure taking on clients such as HDFC Bank \\nHDFCBANK\\n and global seed company Syngenta.\\nDhruva Space became one of the first to be handed a permit to operate satellite communication centres on earth - to date the dominion of ISRO.\\n\"India is a software powerhouse and produces some of the best minds in the world in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The space downstream market is, at the end of the day, a software play,\" said Aravind Ravichandran, founder of France-based advisory firm Terrawatch Space.\\nThe consultancy Euroconsult forecasts that between 2023 and 2032, about 26,104 small satellites - weighing less than 500 kilogrammes (1,100 lb) - will be put in orbit, averaging 1.5 tons of daily launch mass. The firm expects the overall small satellite industry to be worth $110.5 billion in the next decade.\\nIndian space companies have already seen an influx of funding - $126 million in 2023, a 7% increase from the $118 million raised in 2022 and an increase of 235% from the $37.6 million raised in 2021, according to Tracxn data. \\nBut India has only about 2% of market share in commercial space activities, demand is still largely dependent on global clients, and well-established U.S., Russian and Chinese companies are formidable rivals.\\n     \"To truly make a dent, (Indian) solutions have to scale to the rest of south Asia and then to the rest of the world,\" said Pixxel founder and CEO Awais Ahmed.\\n($1 = 84.0560 Indian rupees)\\n', 'Sensex and Nifty extended their losses by 0.3 percent each by noon on October 11, pulled down by banking and auto stocks.

Despite this, the risk-to-reward ratio remains favourable for the long side, making it a good buying opportunity on dips.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 520, Rs 530\\nStop-Loss: Rs 485\\nSun TV Network | CMP: Rs 795\\nSun TV Network has seen a breakdown from a pennant formation, with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts, accompanied by negative divergence. The stock faces resistance near the Rs 825 level, which is the breakdown point. The next swing supports are at Rs 780 and Rs 765, which are short-term targets. The stock has also seen short buildup, which is negative from a derivatives perspective. Hence, one can sell Sun TV on a rise near Rs 805.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 780, Rs 765\\nStop-Loss: Rs 825\\nHDFC Asset Management Company | CMP: Rs 4,133\\nHDFC AMC has broken its crucial uptrend line support with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts. The medium-term indicators have turned bearish with a negative divergence. The stock seems to have completed its medium-term uptrend and has seen significant long unwinding. Therefore, it is recommended to sell on a rise near Rs 4,140 for a better risk-to-reward ratio.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 3,970, Rs 3,900\\nStop-Loss: Rs 4,210\\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart\\nRR Kabel | CMP: Rs 1,772\\nOn a longer timeframe, RR Kabel has witnessed a breakout from a long consolidation pattern with strong volume and closed above Rs 1,760. On the daily chart, it has formed a strong base, and the uptrend remains intact. A new leg of the rally towards Rs 1,800 is expected. The overall structure is very attractive, as the stock is trading above its key moving averages. On the upside, Rs 1,800 is the immediate resistance; above this, a move towards Rs 1,900 can be expected in the near term. On the downside, Rs 1,670 is a crucial support level in case of any correction. The momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are positively poised, supporting the current strength.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,914\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,670\\nInfosys | CMP: Rs 1,934\\nInfosys is gaining momentum after forming a strong base at the 50-DMA (Daily Moving Average). On the weekly chart, a Flag formation is visible, but a breakout is awaited above Rs 1,975. The 50-DMA at Rs 1,875 is a crucial support level. On the upside, Rs 1,975 is the immediate resistance; a breakout above this may trigger bullish momentum towards the Rs 2,000+ level. The stock is trading above all important moving averages, with a positive bias in momentum indicators.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,030\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,870\\neMudhra | CMP: Rs 882\\neMudhra has been consolidating in the range of Rs 820 to Rs 900 for the past 18 trading sessions. A cluster of moving averages has formed a strong base at Rs 820, making the stock attractive on a long-term basis. On the higher side, Rs 900 is a key resistance; a breakout above this level could trigger a move towards Rs 950+ in the shorter to longer timeframe. On the downside, Rs 820 serves as an important support during any correction.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 952\\nStop-Loss: Rs 820\\nMehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi\\nReliance Industries | CMP: Rs 2,741.5\\nReliance Industries has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 3,100 zone towards Rs 2,700. On the intraday charts, the stock appears oversold. The stock is also hovering near the 100% extension of the previous move, suggesting the possibility of a bounce in the coming sessions. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 2,750, with a target of Rs 2,830.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,830\\nStop-Loss: Rs 2,710\\nHDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,617.8\\nHDFC Bank has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 1,800 zone towards Rs 1,600. The intraday charts indicate that the stock is oversold and is hovering near its previous consolidation zone (Rs 1,640 – Rs 1,600), which presents a favourable risk-to-reward scenario for a long trade. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 1,630, targeting Rs 1,690.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,690\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,600\\nTriveni Engineering and Industries | CMP: Rs 434.8\\nA few sessions ago, the entire market was excited about sugar stocks, but due to the ongoing pessimism, even sugar stocks have taken a hit. Triveni has corrected from the Rs 510 zone and retraced significantly as per its previous move. The stock is hovering near Ichimoku support on the daily chart. Traders are advised to go long in the stock above Rs 440, targeting Rs 475.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 475\\nStop-Loss: Rs 425\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The country already has an historical advantage in data mining and interpretation.\"\\nSince February, India has opened its space sector to private players and created a 10 billion rupee ($119 million) venture fund to support space startups. It has also unveiled plans for crewed space exploration and a mission to Venus, but the focus is on developing commercial ventures.\\nIn many ways it will be an uphill fight. Other countries such as Japan and China have advanced space industries, and designs on cheap launches. Spaceflight itself is difficult; the startup landscape globally is littered with failed boosters and satellite designs.\\nFor India, \"the tech is there and the ability is there... but space is tricky and very competitive, and while private companies have shown that they can create a niche for themselves, we need more proof of concept,\" said Namrata Goswami, a space policy expert at Arizona State University.\\nShe added that the Indian government must be an \"anchor customer\" for private industry.\\nMost of the revenue growth is expected to come from so-called downstream data applications, said Pawan Goenka, chairman of IN-SPACe, India\\'s space regulatory body.\\nThose involve crunching data from orbit to help improve crop yields on earth, build more accurate navigation systems, bolster telecommunications, tighten border security and fight climate change, Goenka said.\\nIndian companies such as Bellatrix Aerospace, Pixxel, Agnikul Cosmos, Dhruva Space and others are already building or have launched small satellites or satellite components.\\nIndia\\'s space agency, ISRO, last month completed the third and final developmental flight for its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle. The design will then be handed to private companies.\\n\"The end uses of Earth observation are vast,\" Goenka said. \"What we are doing is address various parts of the puzzle.\"\\nBengaluru-based SatSure, for example, has been providing near real-time satellite data to the Airports Authority of India to enhance air traffic management and safety, helping airlines save fuel costs by improved flight planning. The project is expected to save 37.5 billion rupees ($446 million) in fuel costs for airlines annually by 2025 and result in a roughly 70% reduction in airport process planning timelines, the authority said.\\nEarth observation (EO) satellites - orbiting cameras and sensors - can unlock similar savings in other areas, said the company\\'s chief executive, Prateep Basu.\\n\"EO is solving problems that span across utilities, navigation, trading, industries, helping save millions of dollars,\" Basu said.\\nGOVERNMENT PUSH\\nSince the government opened up the market, companies big and small have jumped in, with legacy IT firms like Infosys \\nINFY1!\\n investing in satellite imaging company GalaxEye Space Solutions, Google-backed \\nGOOG\\n Pixxel signing contracts with NASA, and Baring- and Promus-backed SatSure taking on clients such as HDFC Bank \\nHDFCBANK\\n and global seed company Syngenta.\\nDhruva Space became one of the first to be handed a permit to operate satellite communication centres on earth - to date the dominion of ISRO.\\n\"India is a software powerhouse and produces some of the best minds in the world in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The space downstream market is, at the end of the day, a software play,\" said Aravind Ravichandran, founder of France-based advisory firm Terrawatch Space.\\nThe consultancy Euroconsult forecasts that between 2023 and 2032, about 26,104 small satellites - weighing less than 500 kilogrammes (1,100 lb) - will be put in orbit, averaging 1.5 tons of daily launch mass. The firm expects the overall small satellite industry to be worth $110.5 billion in the next decade.\\nIndian space companies have already seen an influx of funding - $126 million in 2023, a 7% increase from the $118 million raised in 2022 and an increase of 235% from the $37.6 million raised in 2021, according to Tracxn data. \\nBut India has only about 2% of market share in commercial space activities, demand is still largely dependent on global clients, and well-established U.S., Russian and Chinese companies are formidable rivals.\\n     \"To truly make a dent, (Indian) solutions have to scale to the rest of south Asia and then to the rest of the world,\" said Pixxel founder and CEO Awais Ahmed.\\n($1 = 84.0560 Indian rupees)\\n', 'Sensex and Nifty extended their losses by 0.3 percent each by noon on October 11, pulled down by banking and auto stocks. Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) sell-offs, weak Q2 FY25 earnings projections, and rising geopolitical tensions are dampening market sentiment.\\nBy 11:45 AM, the Sensex had dropped 250 points to 81,365, while the Nifty fell 65 points, sitting at 24,932.\\nIn contrast, the broader market offered some respite, with the BSE Midcap rising 0.1 percent and the BSE Smallcap up 0.3 percent.\\nAs the focus shifts to earnings season, analysts anticipate volatility to rise, with more opportunities emerging in the broader market.\\nFollow our live blog for all the market action\\nSectoral Trend\\nBanking and auto stocks led the market\\'s decline. Nifty Bank fell nearly 1 percent, dragged down by heavyweights ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. Meanwhile, Nifty Auto declined 0.4 percent, with M&M, Maruti Suzuki, and Bajaj Auto among the top losers.\\nOn the other hand, oil & gas and metal stocks rallied.

About 2,303 shares declined, compared to 270 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is likely to extend its southward journey if it fails to hold the previous day's low. Until then, consolidation can't be ruled out. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:\\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\\nVedanta | CMP: Rs 500\\nTechnically, Vedanta has provided a breakout from a symmetrical triangular pattern with a bullish crossover in both its short-term and medium-term momentum indicators. The stock has also witnessed long buildup over the last few weeks; however, in recent days, there has been some long unwinding due to the overall market sell-off. Despite this, the risk-to-reward ratio remains favourable for the long side, making it a good buying opportunity on dips.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 520, Rs 530\\nStop-Loss: Rs 485\\nSun TV Network | CMP: Rs 795\\nSun TV Network has seen a breakdown from a pennant formation, with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts, accompanied by negative divergence. The stock faces resistance near the Rs 825 level, which is the breakdown point. The next swing supports are at Rs 780 and Rs 765, which are short-term targets. The stock has also seen short buildup, which is negative from a derivatives perspective. Hence, one can sell Sun TV on a rise near Rs 805.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 780, Rs 765\\nStop-Loss: Rs 825\\nHDFC Asset Management Company | CMP: Rs 4,133\\nHDFC AMC has broken its crucial uptrend line support with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts. The medium-term indicators have turned bearish with a negative divergence. The stock seems to have completed its medium-term uptrend and has seen significant long unwinding. Therefore, it is recommended to sell on a rise near Rs 4,140 for a better risk-to-reward ratio.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 3,970, Rs 3,900\\nStop-Loss: Rs 4,210\\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart\\nRR Kabel | CMP: Rs 1,772\\nOn a longer timeframe, RR Kabel has witnessed a breakout from a long consolidation pattern with strong volume and closed above Rs 1,760. On the daily chart, it has formed a strong base, and the uptrend remains intact. A new leg of the rally towards Rs 1,800 is expected. The overall structure is very attractive, as the stock is trading above its key moving averages. On the upside, Rs 1,800 is the immediate resistance; above this, a move towards Rs 1,900 can be expected in the near term. On the downside, Rs 1,670 is a crucial support level in case of any correction. The momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are positively poised, supporting the current strength.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,914\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,670\\nInfosys | CMP: Rs 1,934\\nInfosys is gaining momentum after forming a strong base at the 50-DMA (Daily Moving Average). On the weekly chart, a Flag formation is visible, but a breakout is awaited above Rs 1,975. The 50-DMA at Rs 1,875 is a crucial support level. On the upside, Rs 1,975 is the immediate resistance; a breakout above this may trigger bullish momentum towards the Rs 2,000+ level. The stock is trading above all important moving averages, with a positive bias in momentum indicators.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,030\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,870\\neMudhra | CMP: Rs 882\\neMudhra has been consolidating in the range of Rs 820 to Rs 900 for the past 18 trading sessions. A cluster of moving averages has formed a strong base at Rs 820, making the stock attractive on a long-term basis. On the higher side, Rs 900 is a key resistance; a breakout above this level could trigger a move towards Rs 950+ in the shorter to longer timeframe. On the downside, Rs 820 serves as an important support during any correction.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 952\\nStop-Loss: Rs 820\\nMehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi\\nReliance Industries | CMP: Rs 2,741.5\\nReliance Industries has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 3,100 zone towards Rs 2,700. On the intraday charts, the stock appears oversold. The stock is also hovering near the 100% extension of the previous move, suggesting the possibility of a bounce in the coming sessions. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 2,750, with a target of Rs 2,830.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,830\\nStop-Loss: Rs 2,710\\nHDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,617.8\\nHDFC Bank has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 1,800 zone towards Rs 1,600. The intraday charts indicate that the stock is oversold and is hovering near its previous consolidation zone (Rs 1,640 – Rs 1,600), which presents a favourable risk-to-reward scenario for a long trade. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 1,630, targeting Rs 1,690.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,690\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,600\\nTriveni Engineering and Industries | CMP: Rs 434.8\\nA few sessions ago, the entire market was excited about sugar stocks, but due to the ongoing pessimism, even sugar stocks have taken a hit. Triveni has corrected from the Rs 510 zone and retraced significantly as per its previous move. The stock is hovering near Ichimoku support on the daily chart. Traders are advised to go long in the stock above Rs 440, targeting Rs 475.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 475\\nStop-Loss: Rs 425\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The country already has an historical advantage in data mining and interpretation.\"\\nSince February, India has opened its space sector to private players and created a 10 billion rupee ($119 million) venture fund to support space startups. It has also unveiled plans for crewed space exploration and a mission to Venus, but the focus is on developing commercial ventures.\\nIn many ways it will be an uphill fight.

The project is expected to save 37.5 billion rupees ($446 million) in fuel costs for airlines annually by 2025 and result in a roughly 70% reduction in airport process planning timelines, the authority said.\\nEarth observation (EO) satellites - orbiting cameras and sensors - can unlock similar savings in other areas, said the company\\'s chief executive, Prateep Basu.\\n\"EO is solving problems that span across utilities, navigation, trading, industries, helping save millions of dollars,\" Basu said.\\nGOVERNMENT PUSH\\nSince the government opened up the market, companies big and small have jumped in, with legacy IT firms like Infosys \\nINFY1!\\n investing in satellite imaging company GalaxEye Space Solutions, Google-backed \\nGOOG\\n Pixxel signing contracts with NASA, and Baring- and Promus-backed SatSure taking on clients such as HDFC Bank \\nHDFCBANK\\n and global seed company Syngenta.\\nDhruva Space became one of the first to be handed a permit to operate satellite communication centres on earth - to date the dominion of ISRO.\\n\"India is a software powerhouse and produces some of the best minds in the world in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

The firm expects the overall small satellite industry to be worth $110.5 billion in the next decade.\\nIndian space companies have already seen an influx of funding - $126 million in 2023, a 7% increase from the $118 million raised in 2022 and an increase of 235% from the $37.6 million raised in 2021, according to Tracxn data. \\nBut India has only about 2% of market share in commercial space activities, demand is still largely dependent on global clients, and well-established U.S., Russian and Chinese companies are formidable rivals.\\n     \"To truly make a dent, (Indian) solutions have to scale to the rest of south Asia and then to the rest of the world,\" said Pixxel founder and CEO Awais Ahmed.\\n($1 = 84.0560 Indian rupees)\\n', 'Sensex and Nifty extended their losses by 0.3 percent each by noon on October 11, pulled down by banking and auto stocks.

The medium-term indicators have turned bearish with a negative divergence. The stock seems to have completed its medium-term uptrend and has seen significant long unwinding. Therefore, it is recommended to sell on a rise near Rs 4,140 for a better risk-to-reward ratio.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 3,970, Rs 3,900\\nStop-Loss: Rs 4,210\\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart\\nRR Kabel | CMP: Rs 1,772\\nOn a longer timeframe, RR Kabel has witnessed a breakout from a long consolidation pattern with strong volume and closed above Rs 1,760. On the daily chart, it has formed a strong base, and the uptrend remains intact. A new leg of the rally towards Rs 1,800 is expected. The overall structure is very attractive, as the stock is trading above its key moving averages. On the upside, Rs 1,800 is the immediate resistance; above this, a move towards Rs 1,900 can be expected in the near term. On the downside, Rs 1,670 is a crucial support level in case of any correction. The momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are positively poised, supporting the current strength.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,914\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,670\\nInfosys | CMP: Rs 1,934\\nInfosys is gaining momentum after forming a strong base at the 50-DMA (Daily Moving Average). On the weekly chart, a Flag formation is visible, but a breakout is awaited above Rs 1,975. The 50-DMA at Rs 1,875 is a crucial support level. On the upside, Rs 1,975 is the immediate resistance; a breakout above this may trigger bullish momentum towards the Rs 2,000+ level. The stock is trading above all important moving averages, with a positive bias in momentum indicators.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,030\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,870\\neMudhra | CMP: Rs 882\\neMudhra has been consolidating in the range of Rs 820 to Rs 900 for the past 18 trading sessions. A cluster of moving averages has formed a strong base at Rs 820, making the stock attractive on a long-term basis. On the higher side, Rs 900 is a key resistance; a breakout above this level could trigger a move towards Rs 950+ in the shorter to longer timeframe. On the downside, Rs 820 serves as an important support during any correction.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 952\\nStop-Loss: Rs 820\\nMehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi\\nReliance Industries | CMP: Rs 2,741.5\\nReliance Industries has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 3,100 zone towards Rs 2,700. On the intraday charts, the stock appears oversold. The stock is also hovering near the 100% extension of the previous move, suggesting the possibility of a bounce in the coming sessions. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 2,750, with a target of Rs 2,830.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,830\\nStop-Loss: Rs 2,710\\nHDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,617.8\\nHDFC Bank has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 1,800 zone towards Rs 1,600. The intraday charts indicate that the stock is oversold and is hovering near its previous consolidation zone (Rs 1,640 – Rs 1,600), which presents a favourable risk-to-reward scenario for a long trade. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 1,630, targeting Rs 1,690.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,690\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,600\\nTriveni Engineering and Industries | CMP: Rs 434.8\\nA few sessions ago, the entire market was excited about sugar stocks, but due to the ongoing pessimism, even sugar stocks have taken a hit. Triveni has corrected from the Rs 510 zone and retraced significantly as per its previous move. The stock is hovering near Ichimoku support on the daily chart. Traders are advised to go long in the stock above Rs 440, targeting Rs 475.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 475\\nStop-Loss: Rs 425\\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

      "Found a similar response for 'Can you provide a detailed investment report on icici bank?': Based on the analysis of ICICI Bank's financials, market sentiment, and recent performance, it is evident that the company has shown strong returns and revenue growth in the financial services sector. The P/E ratio indicates potential undervaluation or low growth expectations, and the debt to equity ratio suggests a conservative capital structure. The technical analysis indicates a bullish trend, with the stock currently trading at 1231.75. The moving averages, MACD, RSI, and stochastic indicators suggest a bullish trend, while the volume is below average. The sentiment analysis of the market surrounding ICICI Bank indicates that there are concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East impacting the stock market, particularly affecting banking, FMCG, and auto stocks. However, analysts believe that the long-term trend in Indian markets remains intact. Considering all these factors, ICICI Bank appears to be a strong investment opportunity with potential for growth and stability.\n"
