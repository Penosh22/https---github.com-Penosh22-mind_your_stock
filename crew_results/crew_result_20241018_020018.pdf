Tata Motors Limited, a Consumer Cyclical company in the Auto Manufacturers industry, exhibits a P/E ratio of 10.13, P/B ratio of 4.02, P/S ratio of 0.83, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 117.15. The company has shown a revenue growth of 26.86% and a net income growth of 12.01% year over year. With a market cap of 3.67 trillion and an enterprise value of 4.05 trillion, Tata Motors' EV/EBITDA stands at 7.93 and EV/Revenue at 0.91. The simple DCF valuation yields a value of approximately 4.84 trillion. The company's low P/E suggests potential undervaluation or low growth expectations, while its high debt-to-equity ratio raises concerns about leverage. The strong revenue growth indicates positive momentum. Considering these factors, a hold recommendation is suggested, pending further analysis of the company's profitability and debt management.
