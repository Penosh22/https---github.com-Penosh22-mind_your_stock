The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023 was a multifaceted event primarily driven by a combination of poor management decisions, a high proportion of uninsured deposits, and external economic pressures. 

1. **Management Missteps**: The bank's senior leadership failed to manage basic risks effectively, leading to vulnerabilities in its financial structure. This mismanagement was highlighted in a report by the Federal Reserve.

2. **Interest Rate Increases**: The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates over the previous year significantly reduced the market value of SVB's investment portfolio, which was heavily invested in long-term securities. As interest rates rose, the value of these securities fell, creating a financial strain on the bank.

3. **Depositor Behavior**: As interest rates increased, depositors began withdrawing their funds in search of better returns elsewhere. This sudden rush to withdraw funds forced SVB to sell some of its Treasury bonds at a loss, further exacerbating its financial troubles.

4. **Run on the Bank**: In a matter of days, SVB went from being solvent to insolvent as depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. This panic led to a classic bank run, where the bank could not meet the withdrawal demands of its clients.

5. **Incompetence and Crisis**: The collapse was characterized as a result of banking mismanagement rather than a crisis in the technology sector, as noted by industry experts. The bank's failure was not due to a lack of viable technology investments but rather a failure to manage its financial risks adequately.

In summary, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was a result of a combination of internal mismanagement, external economic pressures from rising interest rates, and a sudden loss of depositor confidence leading to a bank run.
