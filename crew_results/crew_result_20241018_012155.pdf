Tata Motors Limited operates in the Consumer Cyclical sector, specifically in Auto Manufacturing. The company shows a low P/E ratio of 10.13, indicating potential undervaluation. Key ratios include a P/B of 4.02 and a Debt-to-Equity of 117.15, suggesting high leverage. Revenue growth is strong at 26.86% YoY, with net income growth at 12.01%. The DCF valuation estimates the company’s worth at approximately ₹4.84 trillion. Given the competitive advantages and growth potential, I recommend a "Buy" for Tata Motors, with a focus on its strong revenue growth and market position.
