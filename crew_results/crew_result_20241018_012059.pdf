Tata Motors Limited operates in the Consumer Cyclical sector, specifically in Auto Manufacturing. The company shows a low P/E ratio of 10.13, indicating potential undervaluation, but a high debt-to-equity ratio of 117.15 suggests significant leverage. Revenue growth is strong at 26.86% YoY, with net income growth at 12.01%. Key metrics include a P/B ratio of 4.02 and a net profit margin of 7.61%. The DCF valuation estimates the company’s worth at approximately ₹4.84 trillion. Given the growth potential and risks, a "Hold" recommendation is advised, monitoring for further developments.
