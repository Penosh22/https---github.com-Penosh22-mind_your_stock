The investment report on NTPC Limited suggests a cautious hold recommendation, considering the company's high leverage and potential profitability issues. The 12-month price target ranges from Rs 290 to Rs 580, reflecting the potential impact of NTPC Green Energy's IPO. The bullish case is supported by the company's renewable energy expansion plans, while key risks include under-recovery and execution delays.
