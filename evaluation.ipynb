The growth rates show a decline in revenue but an increase in net income. The valuation metrics reveal relatively low EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue.

      "BPCL's current stock price is around INR 337.65, with a 1-year price target ranging from INR 227.25 to INR 477.75, as per analyst estimates. The historical performance shows a 3-year return of 51.86% and a 1-year return of 100.6%. Key financial metrics indicate a P/E ratio of 7.75, revenue growth forecast of 3.4%, and profit growth estimate of -48.6% for FY25. Recent news highlights geopolitical tensions impacting the market, with a focus on the Middle East conflict and its potential impact on crude oil supplies. Market sentiment analysis reveals a predominantly \"hold\" sentiment, with 96 \"hold\", 3 \"sell\", and 1 \"buy\" sentiment counts. This comprehensive analysis suggests potential undervaluation with growth opportunities, but caution is warranted due to geopolitical risks and declining profit growth.\u001b[00m\n",

About 2,303 shares declined, compared to 270 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is likely to extend its southward journey if it fails to hold the previous day's low. Until then, consolidation can't be ruled out. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:\\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\\nVedanta | CMP: Rs 500\\n\\nTechnically, Vedanta has provided a breakout from a symmetrical triangular pattern with a bullish crossover in both its short-term and medium-term momentum indicators. The stock has also witnessed long buildup over the last few weeks; however, in recent days, there has been some long unwinding due to the overall market sell-off. Despite this, the risk-to-reward ratio remains favourable for the long side, making it a good buying opportunity on dips.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 520, Rs 530\\nStop-Loss: Rs 485\\nSun TV Network | CMP: Rs 795\\n\\nSun TV Network has seen a breakdown from a pennant formation, with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts, accompanied by negative divergence. The stock faces resistance near the Rs 825 level, which is the breakdown point. The next swing supports are at Rs 780 and Rs 765, which are short-term targets. The stock has also seen short buildup, which is negative from a derivatives perspective. Hence, one can sell Sun TV on a rise near Rs 805.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 780, Rs 765\\nStop-Loss: Rs 825\\nHDFC Asset Management Company | CMP: Rs 4,133\\n\\nHDFC AMC has broken its crucial uptrend line support with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts. The medium-term indicators have turned bearish with a negative divergence. The stock seems to have completed its medium-term uptrend and has seen significant long unwinding. Therefore, it is recommended to sell on a rise near Rs 4,140 for a better risk-to-reward ratio.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 3,970, Rs 3,900\\nStop-Loss: Rs 4,210\\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart\\nRR Kabel | CMP: Rs 1,772\\n\\nOn a longer timeframe, RR Kabel has witnessed a breakout from a long consolidation pattern with strong volume and closed above Rs 1,760. On the daily chart, it has formed a strong base, and the uptrend remains intact. A new leg of the rally towards Rs 1,800 is expected. The overall structure is very attractive, as the stock is trading above its key moving averages. On the upside, Rs 1,800 is the immediate resistance; above this, a move towards Rs 1,900 can be expected in the near term. On the downside, Rs 1,670 is a crucial support level in case of any correction. The momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are positively poised, supporting the current strength.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,914\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,670\\nInfosys | CMP: Rs 1,934\\n\\nInfosys is gaining momentum after forming a strong base at the 50-DMA (Daily Moving Average). On the weekly chart, a Flag formation is visible, but a breakout is awaited above Rs 1,975. The 50-DMA at Rs 1,875 is a crucial support level. On the upside, Rs 1,975 is the immediate resistance; a breakout above this may trigger bullish momentum towards the Rs 2,000+ level. The stock is trading above all important moving averages, with a positive bias in momentum indicators.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,030\\nStop-Loss: Rs 1,870\\neMudhra | CMP: Rs 882\\n\\neMudhra has been consolidating in the range of Rs 820 to Rs 900 for the past 18 trading sessions. A cluster of moving averages has formed a strong base at Rs 820, making the stock attractive on a long-term basis. On the higher side, Rs 900 is a key resistance; a breakout above this level could trigger a move towards Rs 950+ in the shorter to longer timeframe. On the downside, Rs 820 serves as an important support during any correction.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 952\\nStop-Loss: Rs 820\\nMehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand RathiReliance Industries | CMP: Rs 2,741.5\\n\\nReliance Industries has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 3,100 zone towards Rs 2,700. On the intraday charts, the stock appears oversold. The stock is also hovering near the 100% extension of the previous move, suggesting the possibility of a bounce in the coming sessions. Traders are advised to buy the stock only above Rs 2,750, with a target of Rs 2,830.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 2,830\\nStop-Loss: Rs 2,710\\nHDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,617.8\\n\\nHDFC Bank has been falling consistently over the past 5-6 trading sessions, from the Rs 1,800 zone towards Rs 1,600. The intraday charts indicate that the stock is oversold and is hovering near its previous consolidation zone (Rs 1,640 – Rs 1,600), which presents a favourable risk-to-reward scenario for a long trade.

We see VEDL weaving its growth story around two ‘Vs’ and one ‘C’ viz. volume, value, and cost reduction–across segments, especially in its aluminium (Al) and Zinc-India (Zn-India) divisions. Key points: 1) Significant volume growth aspirations for all divisions. 2) Al/Zn-India – potentially key earnings growth drivers. 3) Oil & gas (O&G) production is likely to bottom up by FY26E. 4) Growth vectors at VEDL may help pare debt by USD 3bn over the next three years. 5) Dividend yield could sustain at >5% p.a. Put together, we envisage an EBITDA CAGR of 25% YoY through FY26E and RoE of 40–45% over the next two years. A SoTP-based valuation arrives at a TP of INR 600, implying an EV/EBITDA of 5.7x on FY26E and FY27E blended EBITDA (50% weight each).\\nOutlook\\nWe value VEDL on the SoTP methodology. Our TP works out to INR 600/share, implying a 17% upside from CMP. Besides, dividend yield of 5–6% over the next three years is an additional sweetener.

On the NSE, approximately 1,243 shares declined, while 1,231 shares advanced. The index is likely to consolidate further in the coming sessions before the start of a new leg of an upmove. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:\\nRajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities\\nVedanta | CMP: Rs 513\\n\\nVedanta is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, reflecting bullish sentiment. On the weekly time frame, the stock decisively broke out of the past five-month \"consolidation range\" (Rs 480-400) at the Rs 480 level on a closing basis, indicating a strong breakout. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The daily and weekly \"Bollinger Bands\" buy signals show this heightened participation. The stock is well-positioned above its 20,\\xa050,\\xa0100, and 200-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in positive terrain, justifying rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 555-600 and a downside support zone of Rs 480-470 levels.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 555, Rs 600\\nStop-Loss: Rs 480Westlife Foodworld | CMP: Rs 930.5\\n\\nOn the daily and weekly time frames, Westlife Foodworld has formed higher tops and bottoms, indicating a trend reversal. The stock has also confirmed a one-year \"down-sloping trendline\" breakout at the Rs 900 level, accompanied by huge volumes. The daily and weekly \"Bollinger Bands\" buy signals indicate increased participation. The stock is well-positioned above its 20,\\xa050,\\xa0100, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also rising along with the price, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI is in positive terrain, reflecting rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 1,000-1,095 and a downside support zone of Rs 900-875 levels.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,000, Rs 1,095\\nStop-Loss: Rs 900\\nDr Reddy\\'s Laboratories | CMP: Rs 6,750\\n\\nOn the weekly and monthly time frames, Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories is in a strong uptrend, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. With the recent swing low (Rs 6,485), the stock has recaptured its 100-day SMA (Rs 6,438) and rebounded sharply, indicating a strong support zone. The daily and monthly RSI is in positive terrain, signaling rising strength. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 7,000-7,150 and a downside support zone of Rs 6,600-6,490 levels.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 7,000, Rs 7,150\\nStop-Loss: Rs 6,600\\nOsho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One\\nCanara Bank | CMP: Rs 113.1\\n\\nCanara Bank has showcased a strong resurgence from the pivotal support of the 200-day SMA on the daily time frame chart and has broken out of a sloping channel. The price movement has been backed by a noticeable increase in trading volumes, suggesting robust sentiment. Going forward, the breakout on the daily chart is likely to trigger bullish traction in the comparable period. From a technical perspective, the indicators have rebounded, witnessing a positive crossover, which signals a bullish trend in the stock. Hence, we recommend buying Canara Bank around Rs 110.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 122\\nStop-Loss: Rs 104\\nCoal India | CMP: Rs 516.1\\n\\nCoal India is in a stellar uptrend, moving within a cycle of higher highs and higher lows on a broader time frame. In the last session, the stock rebounded from the lower band of its rising channel, coinciding with the support of the 100 DEMA, continuing its primary trend. Additionally, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) signals strong momentum, suggesting a potential upside into uncharted territory for the counter. Hence, we recommend buying Coal India around Rs 515-510.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 574\\nStop-Loss: Rs 486\\nTata Steel | CMP: Rs 166.55\\n\\nTata Steel has demonstrated impressive gains in the recent trading sessions from the short-term EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages), which were backed by robust volumes. The stock is comfortably hovering above all its significant EMAs on the daily time frame and has retraced over 50% of the corrective phase. Furthermore, the recent upward momentum has been supported by positive crossovers of the moving averages, suggesting the uptrend will continue. Therefore, we recommend buying Tata Steel around Rs 164-162.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 180\\nStop-Loss: Rs 154\\nNagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities\\nChambal Fertilisers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 525.25\\n\\nThe weekly timeframe chart of Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals indicates a larger range-bound action over the past few months. After a false downside breakout attempt at Rs 480 last week, the stock price has bounced back. The overall weekly chart pattern suggests a bullish \"Flag\" type pattern, and the stock price is expected to break above the neckline of the pattern at Rs 525 in the near term.

The stock price attempted a decisive upside breakout of the upper range of consolidation around the Rs 6,950 level. A sustainable upmove from here could lead to a sharp trended rally.

Yet a growing list of firms including BlackRock \\nB\\nBLK\\n, BMW \\nBMW\\n and Shein are expanding in the country in partnership with local tycoons. It tightens the grip powerful families have on the world’s fifth-largest economy, and sets them up as future global rivals to those knocking on their door. \\nOn paper, the once-markedly socialist country is open for business. Its craving for capital is strong. Overseas companies in most sectors are free to enter the market on their own, unlike in China, where large swathes of the economy were kept off limits and where some sectors, like autos, were opened up on the condition that foreign companies found local partners.\\nThomson Reuters\\nForeign direct investment into India is slowing\\nThe problem is, India’s federal political system and sheer cultural and geographical diversity means it remains a tricky place for international companies. Powerful families offer a shortcut to establishing a nationwide footprint, avoiding cut-throat domestic competition, or achieving both of those things.\\nBlackRock’s decision to re-enter India exemplifies the dilemma. The company run by Larry Fink, which manages over $10 trillion, is in the process of teaming up with Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services \\nJIOFIN\\n in asset and wealth management. The U.S. company exited an Indian joint venture with DSP in 2018 because it didn’t have a path to control. \\nFink is unlikely to have a path to control with Jio but the rapid financialisation of savings in recent years means the market is too attractive for BlackRock to ignore. Partnering with a tycoon is less risky for the U.S. company than trying to beat India’s richest man who wants to push into financial services and is known for obliterating competition. \\nThe desire of foreign companies to defend their market position in India partly explains their rush to subscribe to fundraisings by Reliance’s \\nRS\\n business units in 2020. These include Facebook-owner Meta Platforms' \\nMETA\\n $5.7 billion purchase of a 10% stake in Reliance’s digital and telecoms business. India remains open for U.S. Big Tech but Indian companies are also flexing their muscles more in digital businesses from telecoms to e-commerce as more Indians get smartphones. \\nElsewhere, New Delhi is encouraging partnerships through subsidies in its flagship production-linked incentive scheme to spur manufacturing. This allows the government to dictate which foreign companies team up with which Indian families to be the next leaders in future industries.\\nTaiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry \\n2317\\n, more widely known as Foxconn, pulled out of a joint venture last year to make chips with Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta \\nVEDL\\n after widespread concerns about the Indian company’s debt and its ability to fund investments. Meanwhile, global companies like French oil giant TotalEnergies \\nTTE\\n are burnishing their green credentials by partnering with Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, who has big ambitions in renewable energy. Smoother access to subsidies is one reason companies including Japan’s Fujifilm \\n4901\\n are scouting for local partners before they start production in India.\\nIt’s significant that many of the new partnerships are in the realm of technology. Adani’s group will work with Israel’s Tower Semiconductor \\nTSEM\\n to build a chip fabrication plant; German carmaker BMW and Tata Technologies \\nTATATECH\\n plan to leverage Indian talent in IT to develop intellectual property that will drive cars of the future. \\nThomson Reuters\\nTycoons lead a third of India's benchmark index\\nWhile India’s approach to inward investment differs from China’s in many ways, the country desires the same thing as its neighbour wanted from foreign multinationals: know-how. \\nThe government yearns for the South Asian nation to become a manufacturing powerhouse. India’s leading business families also want to dominate in their home market and to break out as leaders on the global stage. After picking up a stake in UK telecom operator BT \\nBT.A\\n last month, Bharti Enterprises Chair Sunil Bharti Mittal told journalists India's government is continuously encouraging a handful of companies which have gone global to accelerate the process.\\nThat sets up the potential for at least some of the new Indian alliances to sour, just as several Chinese joint ventures did. True, some foreign companies that ventured into the People’s Republic simply failed to keep up with fast-changing local consumer preferences. Others, though, said they were pressured into handing over technology to their private or state-backed joint venture partners, to local officials or to Chinese regulators as a condition for doing in business in the world’s second-largest economy.  \\nThat complaint took centre stage in a trade war launched in 2018 by then U.S. President Donald Trump. When Stellantis \\nSTLAM\\n ended its joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group \\n601238\\n in 2022, the European carmaker’s CEO Carlos Tavares blamed rising “political influence” in doing business with partners in China.\\nIt is therefore perhaps unsurprising that Chinese companies have the least freedom to operate on their own in India. The government turned up the heat on companies from the People’s Republic after a deadly skirmish between the two countries’ militaries along the Himalayan border in 2020. This tension has resulted in some particularly eye-catching joint ventures struck by Chinese companies that want to continue to expand in the fast-growing Indian market. \\nFour years after New Delhi banned Shein’s app, the fast-fashion company which was founded in China is back in partnership with Ambani’s $240 billion Reliance Industries. Together they plan to digitise the supply chains of the conglomerate’s retailer, manufacture goods and export them to the world. Similarly, less than two years since India launched an investigation into a local unit of Chinese automotive giant SAIC Motor \\n600104\\n, the company finalised a joint venture in March to sell its MG-branded cars in partnership with Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Group. \\nNew arrivals at least have some examples of successful foreign joint ventures in India to aspire to. Take $46 billion Maruti Suzuki \\nMARUTI\\n, purveyor of 40% of the country’s cars. This partnership with Japan’s Suzuki Motor \\n7269\\n has delivered yearly returns to shareholders over the past decade, including dividends, which exceed those of the benchmark Nifty 50 Index. Meanwhile, Adani Wilmar \\nAWL\\n, the Adani group’s partnership with Singapore’s Wilmar \\nF34\\n, established a quarter of a century ago, is behind India’s largest selling edible oil brand.\\nThomson Reuters\\nSuzuki's Indian joint venture is a standout success\\nOutside of joint ventures, some foreign companies have had more luck than others on their own in India. South Korea’s Samsung \\n005930\\n has had remarkable success selling smartphones and held a leading position in the consumer electronics market for a long time, but British telecom operator Vodafone \\nVOD\\n struggled with a price war and merged with India’s Idea Cellular in 2018. Whether or not India is open for business, foreign business alliances are accumulating even more power in the hands of the country’s leading tycoons.\\nFollow @ShritamaBose on X\\n\"]\n",

      "Vedanta Limited operates in the Basic Materials sector, specifically in the Other Industrial Metals & Mining industry. The company's key ratios reveal a P/E ratio of 35.14, indicating potential overvaluation or high growth expectations, and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 172.98, signifying significant leverage. The revenue growth (YoY) is negative at -2.48%, and the net income growth (YoY) is at -59.91%, indicating slowing growth and potential profitability issues. The company's DCF valuation stands at approximately 2.51 trillion, suggesting a current market undervaluation. Considering the high P/E and debt levels, caution is advised, and a \"hold\" recommendation is appropriate pending further analysis.\u001b[00m\n",

About 2,303 shares declined, compared to 270 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is likely to extend its southward journey if it fails to hold the previous day's low. Until then, consolidation can't be ruled out. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:\\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\\nVedanta | CMP: Rs 500\\n\\nTechnically, Vedanta has provided a breakout from a symmetrical triangular pattern with a bullish crossover in both its short-term and medium-term momentum indicators. The stock has also witnessed long buildup over the last few weeks; however, in recent days, there has been some long unwinding due to the overall market sell-off. Despite this, the risk-to-reward ratio remains favourable for the long side, making it a good buying opportunity on dips.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 520, Rs 530\\nStop-Loss: Rs 485\\nSun TV Network | CMP: Rs 795\\n\\nSun TV Network has seen a breakdown from a pennant formation, with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts, accompanied by negative divergence. The stock faces resistance near the Rs 825 level, which is the breakdown point. The next swing supports are at Rs 780 and Rs 765, which are short-term targets. The stock has also seen short buildup, which is negative from a derivatives perspective. Hence, one can sell Sun TV on a rise near Rs 805.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 780, Rs 765\\nStop-Loss: Rs 825\\nHDFC Asset Management Company | CMP: Rs 4,133\\n\\nHDFC AMC has broken its crucial uptrend line support with a sell crossover in both its short-term and medium-term charts. The medium-term indicators have turned bearish with a negative divergence. The stock seems to have completed its medium-term uptrend and has seen significant long unwinding. Therefore, it is recommended to sell on a rise near Rs 4,140 for a better risk-to-reward ratio.\\nStrategy: Sell\\nTarget: Rs 3,970, Rs 3,900\\nStop-Loss: Rs 4,210\\nPravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart\\nRR Kabel | CMP: Rs 1,772\\n\\nOn a longer timeframe, RR Kabel has witnessed a breakout from a long consolidation pattern with strong volume and closed above Rs 1,760. On the daily chart, it has formed a strong base, and the uptrend remains intact. A new leg of the rally towards Rs 1,800 is expected. The overall structure is very attractive, as the stock is trading above its key moving averages. On the upside, Rs 1,800 is the immediate resistance; above this, a move towards Rs 1,900 can be expected in the near term.

We see VEDL weaving its growth story around two ‘Vs’ and one ‘C’ viz. volume, value, and cost reduction–across segments, especially in its aluminium (Al) and Zinc-India (Zn-India) divisions. Key points: 1) Significant volume growth aspirations for all divisions. 2) Al/Zn-India – potentially key earnings growth drivers. 3) Oil & gas (O&G) production is likely to bottom up by FY26E. 4) Growth vectors at VEDL may help pare debt by USD 3bn over the next three years. 5) Dividend yield could sustain at >5% p.a. Put together, we envisage an EBITDA CAGR of 25% YoY through FY26E and RoE of 40–45% over the next two years. A SoTP-based valuation arrives at a TP of INR 600, implying an EV/EBITDA of 5.7x on FY26E and FY27E blended EBITDA (50% weight each).\\nOutlook\\nWe value VEDL on the SoTP methodology. Our TP works out to INR 600/share, implying a 17% upside from CMP. Besides, dividend yield of 5–6% over the next three years is an additional sweetener.

On the NSE, approximately 1,243 shares declined, while 1,231 shares advanced. The index is likely to consolidate further in the coming sessions before the start of a new leg of an upmove. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:\\nRajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities\\nVedanta | CMP: Rs 513\\n\\nVedanta is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, reflecting bullish sentiment. On the weekly time frame, the stock decisively broke out of the past five-month \"consolidation range\" (Rs 480-400) at the Rs 480 level on a closing basis, indicating a strong breakout. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The daily and weekly \"Bollinger Bands\" buy signals show this heightened participation. The stock is well-positioned above its 20,\\xa050,\\xa0100, and 200-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in positive terrain, justifying rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 555-600 and a downside support zone of Rs 480-470 levels.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 555, Rs 600\\nStop-Loss: Rs 480Westlife Foodworld | CMP: Rs 930.5\\n\\nOn the daily and weekly time frames, Westlife Foodworld has formed higher tops and bottoms, indicating a trend reversal. The stock has also confirmed a one-year \"down-sloping trendline\" breakout at the Rs 900 level, accompanied by huge volumes. The daily and weekly \"Bollinger Bands\" buy signals indicate increased participation. The stock is well-positioned above its 20,\\xa050,\\xa0100, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also rising along with the price, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI is in positive terrain, reflecting rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 1,000-1,095 and a downside support zone of Rs 900-875 levels.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 1,000, Rs 1,095\\nStop-Loss: Rs 900\\nDr Reddy\\'s Laboratories | CMP: Rs 6,750\\n\\nOn the weekly and monthly time frames, Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories is in a strong uptrend, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. With the recent swing low (Rs 6,485), the stock has recaptured its 100-day SMA (Rs 6,438) and rebounded sharply, indicating a strong support zone. The daily and monthly RSI is in positive terrain, signaling rising strength. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 7,000-7,150 and a downside support zone of Rs 6,600-6,490 levels.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 7,000, Rs 7,150\\nStop-Loss: Rs 6,600\\nOsho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One\\nCanara Bank | CMP: Rs 113.1\\n\\nCanara Bank has showcased a strong resurgence from the pivotal support of the 200-day SMA on the daily time frame chart and has broken out of a sloping channel. The price movement has been backed by a noticeable increase in trading volumes, suggesting robust sentiment. Going forward, the breakout on the daily chart is likely to trigger bullish traction in the comparable period. From a technical perspective, the indicators have rebounded, witnessing a positive crossover, which signals a bullish trend in the stock. Hence, we recommend buying Canara Bank around Rs 110.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 122\\nStop-Loss: Rs 104\\nCoal India | CMP: Rs 516.1\\n\\nCoal India is in a stellar uptrend, moving within a cycle of higher highs and higher lows on a broader time frame. In the last session, the stock rebounded from the lower band of its rising channel, coinciding with the support of the 100 DEMA, continuing its primary trend. Additionally, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) signals strong momentum, suggesting a potential upside into uncharted territory for the counter. Hence, we recommend buying Coal India around Rs 515-510.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 574\\nStop-Loss: Rs 486\\nTata Steel | CMP: Rs 166.55\\n\\nTata Steel has demonstrated impressive gains in the recent trading sessions from the short-term EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages), which were backed by robust volumes. The stock is comfortably hovering above all its significant EMAs on the daily time frame and has retraced over 50% of the corrective phase. Furthermore, the recent upward momentum has been supported by positive crossovers of the moving averages, suggesting the uptrend will continue. Therefore, we recommend buying Tata Steel around Rs 164-162.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 180\\nStop-Loss: Rs 154\\nNagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities\\nChambal Fertilisers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 525.25\\n\\nThe weekly timeframe chart of Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals indicates a larger range-bound action over the past few months. After a false downside breakout attempt at Rs 480 last week, the stock price has bounced back. The overall weekly chart pattern suggests a bullish \"Flag\" type pattern, and the stock price is expected to break above the neckline of the pattern at Rs 525 in the near term. The volume and RSI patterns indicate more upside potential ahead for the stock price.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 575\\nStop-Loss: Rs 495\\nShree Renuka Sugars | CMP: Rs 53.05\\n\\nThe attached weekly time frame chart of Shree Renuka Sugars shows a sustainable upside bounce from last week.

The stock has moved above the hurdles of the weekly 10/20 period EMA and closed higher. Volume has started to expand during the upside breakout, and the weekly RSI signals a positive trend.\\nStrategy: Buy\\nTarget: Rs 7,700\\nStop-Loss: Rs 6,650Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Yet a growing list of firms including BlackRock \\nB\\nBLK\\n, BMW \\nBMW\\n and Shein are expanding in the country in partnership with local tycoons. It tightens the grip powerful families have on the world’s fifth-largest economy, and sets them up as future global rivals to those knocking on their door. \\nOn paper, the once-markedly socialist country is open for business. Its craving for capital is strong. Overseas companies in most sectors are free to enter the market on their own, unlike in China, where large swathes of the economy were kept off limits and where some sectors, like autos, were opened up on the condition that foreign companies found local partners.\\nThomson Reuters\\nForeign direct investment into India is slowing\\nThe problem is, India’s federal political system and sheer cultural and geographical diversity means it remains a tricky place for international companies. Powerful families offer a shortcut to establishing a nationwide footprint, avoiding cut-throat domestic competition, or achieving both of those things.\\nBlackRock’s decision to re-enter India exemplifies the dilemma. The company run by Larry Fink, which manages over $10 trillion, is in the process of teaming up with Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services \\nJIOFIN\\n in asset and wealth management. The U.S. company exited an Indian joint venture with DSP in 2018 because it didn’t have a path to control. \\nFink is unlikely to have a path to control with Jio but the rapid financialisation of savings in recent years means the market is too attractive for BlackRock to ignore. Partnering with a tycoon is less risky for the U.S. company than trying to beat India’s richest man who wants to push into financial services and is known for obliterating competition. \\nThe desire of foreign companies to defend their market position in India partly explains their rush to subscribe to fundraisings by Reliance’s \\nRS\\n business units in 2020. These include Facebook-owner Meta Platforms' \\nMETA\\n $5.7 billion purchase of a 10% stake in Reliance’s digital and telecoms business. India remains open for U.S. Big Tech but Indian companies are also flexing their muscles more in digital businesses from telecoms to e-commerce as more Indians get smartphones. \\nElsewhere, New Delhi is encouraging partnerships through subsidies in its flagship production-linked incentive scheme to spur manufacturing. This allows the government to dictate which foreign companies team up with which Indian families to be the next leaders in future industries.\\nTaiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry \\n2317\\n, more widely known as Foxconn, pulled out of a joint venture last year to make chips with Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta \\nVEDL\\n after widespread concerns about the Indian company’s debt and its ability to fund investments. Meanwhile, global companies like French oil giant TotalEnergies \\nTTE\\n are burnishing their green credentials by partnering with Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, who has big ambitions in renewable energy. Smoother access to subsidies is one reason companies including Japan’s Fujifilm \\n4901\\n are scouting for local partners before they start production in India.\\nIt’s significant that many of the new partnerships are in the realm of technology. Adani’s group will work with Israel’s Tower Semiconductor \\nTSEM\\n to build a chip fabrication plant; German carmaker BMW and Tata Technologies \\nTATATECH\\n plan to leverage Indian talent in IT to develop intellectual property that will drive cars of the future. \\nThomson Reuters\\nTycoons lead a third of India's benchmark index\\nWhile India’s approach to inward investment differs from China’s in many ways, the country desires the same thing as its neighbour wanted from foreign multinationals: know-how. \\nThe government yearns for the South Asian nation to become a manufacturing powerhouse. India’s leading business families also want to dominate in their home market and to break out as leaders on the global stage. After picking up a stake in UK telecom operator BT \\nBT.A\\n last month, Bharti Enterprises Chair Sunil Bharti Mittal told journalists India's government is continuously encouraging a handful of companies which have gone global to accelerate the process.\\nThat sets up the potential for at least some of the new Indian alliances to sour, just as several Chinese joint ventures did. True, some foreign companies that ventured into the People’s Republic simply failed to keep up with fast-changing local consumer preferences. Others, though, said they were pressured into handing over technology to their private or state-backed joint venture partners, to local officials or to Chinese regulators as a condition for doing in business in the world’s second-largest economy.  \\nThat complaint took centre stage in a trade war launched in 2018 by then U.S. President Donald Trump. When Stellantis \\nSTLAM\\n ended its joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group \\n601238\\n in 2022, the European carmaker’s CEO Carlos Tavares blamed rising “political influence” in doing business with partners in China.\\nIt is therefore perhaps unsurprising that Chinese companies have the least freedom to operate on their own in India. The government turned up the heat on companies from the People’s Republic after a deadly skirmish between the two countries’ militaries along the Himalayan border in 2020. This tension has resulted in some particularly eye-catching joint ventures struck by Chinese companies that want to continue to expand in the fast-growing Indian market. \\nFour years after New Delhi banned Shein’s app, the fast-fashion company which was founded in China is back in partnership with Ambani’s $240 billion Reliance Industries. Together they plan to digitise the supply chains of the conglomerate’s retailer, manufacture goods and export them to the world. Similarly, less than two years since India launched an investigation into a local unit of Chinese automotive giant SAIC Motor \\n600104\\n, the company finalised a joint venture in March to sell its MG-branded cars in partnership with Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Group. \\nNew arrivals at least have some examples of successful foreign joint ventures in India to aspire to. Take $46 billion Maruti Suzuki \\nMARUTI\\n, purveyor of 40% of the country’s cars. This partnership with Japan’s Suzuki Motor \\n7269\\n has delivered yearly returns to shareholders over the past decade, including dividends, which exceed those of the benchmark Nifty 50 Index. Meanwhile, Adani Wilmar \\nAWL\\n, the Adani group’s partnership with Singapore’s Wilmar \\nF34\\n, established a quarter of a century ago, is behind India’s largest selling edible oil brand.\\nThomson Reuters\\nSuzuki's Indian joint venture is a standout success\\nOutside of joint ventures, some foreign companies have had more luck than others on their own in India. South Korea’s Samsung \\n005930\\n has had remarkable success selling smartphones and held a leading position in the consumer electronics market for a long time, but British telecom operator Vodafone \\nVOD\\n struggled with a price war and merged with India’s Idea Cellular in 2018. Whether or not India is open for business, foreign business alliances are accumulating even more power in the hands of the country’s leading tycoons.\\nFollow @ShritamaBose on X\\n\"]\n",

      "**Executive Summary:**\n",
      "Based on the fundamental analysis, Vedanta Limited exhibits a high P/E ratio, significant debt-to-equity ratio, negative revenue and net income growth, and a DCF valuation suggesting undervaluation. The technical analysis indicates a bullish trend, with potential resistance at 523.65 and support at 437. The sentiment analysis reveals a predominantly neutral sentiment from both market and retail perspectives, with a slight negative bias in retail sentiment. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Company Snapshot:**\n",
      "Vedanta Limited operates in the Basic Materials sector, specifically in the Other Industrial Metals & Mining industry. The company's key ratios reveal a P/E ratio of 35.14, indicating potential overvaluation or high growth expectations, and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 172.98, signifying significant leverage. The revenue growth (YoY) is negative at -2.48%, and the net income growth (YoY) is at -59.91%, indicating slowing growth and potential profitability issues. The company's DCF valuation stands at approximately 2.51 trillion, suggesting a current market undervaluation.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Technical Analysis:**\n",
      "The technical analysis indicates a bullish trend, with potential resistance at 523.65 and support at 437. The Moving Averages and Exponential MAs suggest a positive trend, while the MACD and Stochastic indicators show a neutral to bearish sentiment. The RSI is at 55.62, indicating a neutral stance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sentiment Analysis:**\n",
      "The sentiment analysis reveals a predominantly neutral sentiment from both market and retail perspectives, with a slight negative bias in retail sentiment. The market sentiment analysis shows 9 holds and 1 sell, while the retail sentiment analysis indicates 7 neutral, 1 negative, and 2 positive comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investment Thesis:**\n",
      "The high P/E ratio and significant debt levels warrant caution, while the undervaluation indicated by the DCF valuation presents a potential opportunity. The bullish trend in technical analysis aligns with the positive sentiment from the market, despite the slight negative bias in retail sentiment. The slowing growth and profitability concerns highlighted in the fundamental analysis should be considered as potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Risk and Opportunity:**\n",
      "The major risk lies in the company's high debt-to-equity ratio and negative growth metrics, which may impact its financial stability and growth prospects. The opportunity lies in the undervaluation indicated by the DCF valuation and the bullish trend in the technical analysis, which may present a favorable entry point for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Price Target:**\n",
      "Considering the undervaluation indicated by the DCF valuation and the bullish trend in the technical analysis, a 12-month price target of 550-570 is reasonable, with potential resistance at 523.65 and support at 437.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while caution is advised due to the high P/E ratio and significant debt levels, the undervaluation and bullish trend present a compelling investment opportunity for Vedanta Limited.\u001b[00m\n",
